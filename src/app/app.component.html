  <p>Risk disclaimer</p>

  <p>
    CFDs are complex instruments and come with a high risk of losing money
    rapidly due to leverage. 75.28% of retail investor accounts lose money when
    trading CFDs with this provider. You should consider whether you understand
    how CFDs work and whether you can afford to take the high risk of losing
    your money.
  </p>

  <p>
    The National Securities Market commission of Spain (the “CNMV”) has
    determined that, due to the complexity of CFDs and the risks involved, the
    purchase of such a product by Retail Clients is not appropriate/suitable. In
    this respect, pursuant to the relevant requirements introduced by CNMV, you
    are warned that you are about to purchase a product that is complex and
    difficult to understand: Contracts for Differences (CFDs). CNMV has
    determined that, due to its complexity and the risks involved, the purchase
    of this product by retail investors is not appropriate/suitable.
  </p>

  <p>
    Because of such, CFDs may not be the ideal investment for everyone. The high
    rate of leverage that is available to CFD traders can work for or against
    you. You should only invest money that you can afford to lose. CFDs are
    intricate leveraged financial assets. Trading Forex, Commodities, Indexes
    and Shares based CFDs, or any other underlaying instruments of the Company
    implies a high degree of risk and can lead to the loss of your investment.
    Before getting involved with trading, consider your financial goals, your
    skills and gage the possible risks associated with trading Company’s
    Products. Derivate assets like CFDs and likely instruments from other
    markets can present extreme volatility. CFDs may shift price rapidly and may
    depict change in market conditions that result from unforeseeable
    occurrences. None of these facts can be manipulated by either you or FXORO.
    It is best to consult with a licensed financial counselor. FXORO does not
    avail its customers with financial advice and the information provided
